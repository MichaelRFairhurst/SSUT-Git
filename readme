Server-Side Unit Testing for Git

Perhaps pronounced 'suckit' in casual conversation, SUTT-Git is
made to run via cron or hook+ssh to execute arbitrary test suites
on your git repos, and email you the results upon failure.

You can specify separate test commands, home directories,
remotes, and starting dates for each project.

To configure your first project, just alter and/or rename 
config/sample. To add a project, just make a new file with proper
syntax in the config dir.

You can read the sample file for more information on project
configuration, and you can call ssut-git help for information on
runtime configurations.
